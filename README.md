<h1>File_Uploader_NodeJS</h1>
<p>This is a very simple pure NodeJS TCP-Application. In this app you can upload any file from the client to the server and that's it. I did it in a simple way that is very easy to grasp! (at least for me!).</p>
<p>Follow the following steps.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Clone the Repository!</li>
  <li>Then Start the server using node server.js</li>
  <li>Then run the client using node client.js <./**/FilePATH> </li>
</ul>

<h3>Note</h3>
You can also upload the server to amazon web services or anwhere to use it globally or in your specific app!
